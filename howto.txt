To run all analyses including the supplement

1. check for missing packages and install them by using "1_install_missing_packages.R"

2. adjust location of NetLogo in the "2_run_all_experiments.R" script, 
   adjust the number of cores (default is 5 cores/workers used)
   then run the script to start experiments headless via command line and via R (sensitivity analysis)

3. adjust the number of cores (default is 5 cores/workers used)
   process the simulation output with "3_process_simulation_data_all_steps_all_experiments.R"

4. generate the figures with "4_create_all_Figures"


If you want to run individual experiments:

1. run experiment with model ("code/model/POLS_model.nlogo")
2. to aggregate data to (intra-)populational level 
      - open process_simulation_output/process_simulation_data_all_steps.R
      - specify the name and folder of the experiment
      - run the script
3  once all data has been processed (takes some time)
      - run scripts in create_main_text_figures to reproduce figures included in the main text
